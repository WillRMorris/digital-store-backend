  ## Description
  this project is a simulation of a back end store front complete with tags and categories to help sort and define products. I created this as a way to demonstrate an understanding of table relations in a real world sceneraio such as e-comerce 

  ## Installation
    to install, simply clone the repo and run it in the command line using Node.js and use a system such as insomnia to make requests. (remeber to add a force true the first time you run it or it wont work!)

  ## Usage
  insomnia can be used to make localhost requests on server 3001.
